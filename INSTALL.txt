To install the pybufr-ecmwf python module you have several options:

First install the needed dependencies:
* the python module numpy, and its f2py tool
  (sometimes they are in separate packages)
* the subprocess module (should be in the default python installation for 
  newer python versions since 2.4)
* the presence of a Fortran compiler (gfortran from the gcc compiler 
  collection is the default and will do just fine)
* the presence of a c-compiler (gcc for example) 

Then choose one of these:

1) Download the latest tarball and run setup.py
   -visit https://code.google.com/p/pybufr-ecmwf/downloads/list/
    or https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybufr-ecmwf/
    and download the latest software version
   -unpack the software: tar zxvf pybufr-ecmwf-0.73.tar.gz
   -cd pybufr-ecmwf-0.73
   -python setup.py build
   -[local install:]       python setup.py install --user
   -[system wide install:] python setup.py install

2) Use virtualenv and pip
   -virtualenv myenv --system-site-packages
   -[bash] source myenv/bin/activate
   -[csh] source myenv/bin/activate.csh
   -pip install pybufr-ecmwf

3) Check out this git repository and run setup.py:
   -hg clone https://code.google.com/p/pybufr-ecmwf/
   -cd pybufr-ecmwf
   -python setup.py build
   -[local install:]       python setup.py install --user
   -[system wide install:] python setup.py install

To my knowledge to prepackaged versions are available yet. If you wish
to package this software please drop me a note and I'll work with you
to make this as easy as possible.

Note that this module has been developed using Fedora linux and will
probably compile and run on any modern linux distro.
It may run on MacOS, unix or bsd as well, but has not been tested there yet
(if you have tried this please let me know).
The software has not been adapted to any windows version.
You could try to install it in the cygwin or mingw environments in windows
but this has not been tested at all. Any reports on your experience here
are welcome.
