Updated to build and use the new BUFRDC series of the ECMWF library
including the latest version 000400.

Release 0.5 (25-Sep-2012):

Contains mainly small bug fixes and updates the build script to the 
latest library version.

Release 0.4 (06-Sep-2011):

Several fixes have been added in the handling of the BUFR tables, which
now should also work if you provide custom BUFR table names or a custom
BUFR tables directory (as parameter or through the BUFR_TABLES environment
setting) to the module.
In addition functionality to create new BUFR tables from scratch has been
added, including an example script to demonstrate this.

Release 0.3 (22-Apr-2011):

The top level interface for reading a BUFR message is in place now.
Still the code only works properly when you use the BUFR tables
provided by the ECMWF BUFR library.
Compilation with python3 seems to have some difficulties.
The dependency on numpy is no problem anymore, since that one is now
fully ported to python3, but the f2py tool that comes with numpy
seems broken somehow, and crashes during the build process.
The problem has been reported to the numpy developers (see
http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/1932), so for the moment
I'll wait for a bugfix from the numpy team before continuing
the python3 porting effort.

Release 0.2 (21-Oct-2010):

A next wrapper interface is in place now, and a start for the top-level
interface is implemented.
Also, the module can now be converted and compiled using python3.

Release 0.1 (10-Jun-2010):

A first rough test version of this module. The f2py wrapper generation and 
compilation works for me.
Decoding and encoding of BUFR messages already is possible with this
version, if you know what you are doing.
Today I submitted this version to the pypi index, see:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybufr-ecmwf/0.1
so hopefully I will get some feedback on the functioning and coding 
of this module.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or remarks!
