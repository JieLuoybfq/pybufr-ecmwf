Release 0.1 (10-Jun-2010):

A first rough test version of this module. The f2py wrapper generation and 
compilation works for me.
Decoding and encoding of BUFR messages already is possible with this
version, if you know what you are doing.
Today I submitted this version to the pypi index, see:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybufr-ecmwf/0.1
so hopefully I will get some feedback on the functioning and coding 
of this module.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or remarks!
