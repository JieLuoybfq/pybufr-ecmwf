The pybufr_ecmwf module provides functionality to read and write files in BUFR format. 
The API consists of several layers:
-the raw/bare c API that connects python to the fortran library
-an intermediate python API around this raw layer
-[not yet written] a high level API which should allow a pythonic object oriented usage

For examples on its usage you can take a look at the programs in the example_programs directory.
The run_example_program.sh shell script allows easy testing of all of these programs. 
All needed test data files are provided in the example_programs/testdata directory.

examples for using the raw/bare API are:
-example_for_using_ecmwfbufr_for_decoding.py
-example_for_using_ecmwfbufr_for_encoding.py

examples for using the intermediate python API 
-example_for_using_bufrinterface_ecmwf_for_decoding.py
-example_for_using_bufrinterface_ecmwf_for_encoding.py

example for using additional tools:

an example how the pb routines can be used (not portable at the moment, needs more testing!)
-example_for_using_pb_routines.py

an example how the raw_bufr_file class can be used to replace the pb routines
-example_for_using_rawbufrfile.py

an example of a tool that can be used to verify the internal consistency of BUFR table files
-verify_bufr_tables.py
