If you need to ununstall this package, this trick may help you

python setup.py install --record files.txt
cat files.txt | xargs rm -rf

trick found on:
http://kmandla.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/there-is-no-setuppy-uninstall/

note however that some files seem to be let behind at the moment
(I still have to sort out why):

ecmwfbufr_parameters.py   ecmwf_bufrtables  pybufr_ecmwf.py
ecmwfbufr_parameters.pyc  libbufr.a         pybufr_ecmwf.pyc
